# Automated IR processing for the Agor√† project

Run eigenmike.m for the EM64

Run agora_automated.m for the Zoom F8, where channels 1-4 are assumed to be the Ambeo, channels 5-6 are the Neumann dummy head, channel 7 is the Behringer omni.

Both scripts convolve with the inverse sweep, then apply appropriate A-to-B convolution matrices.
